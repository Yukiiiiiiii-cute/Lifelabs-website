        <h1>Global Problem
            Introduction</h1>
        <p>Sexism may be defined as unequal rights of person based on their sexes with females and other gendered people being the worst affected.
           This is backed up by social expectations and cultural beliefs and is quite expressed through education, employment and political realms. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="services">
        <h1>Examples of Gender Inequality</h1>
        <p>Employment: Across the world female workers are paid less compared to their male counterparts for the same job. 
            There is still a gender pay disparity where women earn slightly above two thirds of that earned by men and more specifically 77%.
            Education: In developing nations particularly, girls’ education enrollment to school is lower than that of boys basically due to cultural and economic factors.</p>

    <section id="contact">
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>It remains a social problem that is universal and was manifested in various aspects of people’s lives. 
            To solve it, basic changes must be made in policies, workplace, and norms to offer and protect rights of women and men.</p>
